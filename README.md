# Budgie
Budgie was made by [kodle](https://github.com/kodle) with the help of [Giiltham](https://github.com/Giiltham) to sort my photographs by creating folders named after the date they were taken by importing the EXIF from the metadata.

Alternative in C# with interface from [Giiltham](https://github.com/kodle) at [Giiltham/PhotoSort](https://github.com/giiltham/photosort).
